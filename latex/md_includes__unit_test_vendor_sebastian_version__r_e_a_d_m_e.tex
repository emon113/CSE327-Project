{\bfseries{Version}} is a library that helps with managing the version number of Git-\/hosted PHP projects.\doxysection{Installation}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_sebastian_version__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md568}
You can add this library as a local, per-\/project dependency to your project using {\texttt{ Composer}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}composer require sebastian/version
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project\textquotesingle{}s test suite, then you should add it as a development-\/time dependency\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}composer require --dev sebastian/version
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysection{Usage}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_sebastian_version__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md569}
The constructor of the {\ttfamily Sebastian\+Bergmann\textbackslash{}Version} class expects two parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \$release} is the version number of the latest release ({\ttfamily X.\+Y.\+Z}, for instance) or the name of the release series ({\ttfamily X.\+Y}) when no release has been made from that branch / for that release series yet.
\item {\ttfamily \$path} is the path to the directory (or a subdirectory thereof) where the sourcecode of the project can be found. Simply passing {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+DIR\+\_\+\+\_\+} here usually suffices.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Apart from the constructor, the {\ttfamily Sebastian\+Bergmann\textbackslash{}Version} class has a single public method\+: {\ttfamily get\+Version()}.

Here is a contrived example that shows the basic usage\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<?php
$version = new SebastianBergmann\Version(
  '3.7.10', '/usr/local/src/phpunit'
);

var_dump($version->getVersion());
?>

string(18) "3.7.10-17-g00f3408"
\end{DoxyVerb}
 When a new release is prepared, the string that is passed to the constructor as the first argument needs to be updated.\doxysubsection{How Sebastian\+Bergmann\textbackslash{}\+Version\+::get\+Version() works}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_sebastian_version__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md570}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is not (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y.\+Z} format then {\ttfamily \$release} is returned as-\/is.
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is not (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y} format then {\ttfamily \$release} is returned suffixed with {\ttfamily -\/dev}.
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y.\+Z} format then the output of {\ttfamily git describe -\/-\/tags} is returned as-\/is.
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y} format then a string is returned that begins with {\ttfamily X.\+Y} and ends with information from {\ttfamily git describe -\/-\/tags}.
