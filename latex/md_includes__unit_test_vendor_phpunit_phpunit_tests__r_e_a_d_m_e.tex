This document contains the notes of projects contributors about testing the PHPUnit core and its integration with the most important dependencies.\doxysection{Quick start}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpunit_phpunit_tests__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md304}
There are two main ways to self-\/test PHPUnit. The first is to test {\itshape everything} using the default configuration. Here\textquotesingle{}s how to do that with pretty colors in a human-\/readable format\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd /path/to/phpunit}
\DoxyCodeLine{./phpunit -\/-\/testdox -\/-\/colors=always -\/-\/verbose}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you want to do a very quick check health-\/check of most basic use cases you can use the {\ttfamily basic} test collection\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./phpunit -\/-\/testdox -\/-\/colors=always -\/-\/verbose -\/c tests/basic/configuration.basic.xml}

\end{DoxyCode}


The {\ttfamily basic} suite of tests puts the core system through its paces and covers most of the basic use cases of PHPUnit including happy flows and common exceptions.\doxysection{Running the PHPUnit self-\/tests in Php\+Storm}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpunit_phpunit_tests__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md305}
First, please configure Php\+Storm in the settings\+:

Languages \& Frameworks $>$ PHP $>$ \doxyref{Test}{p.}{class_test} Frameworks\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item PHPUnit library\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [x] Path to phpunit.\+phar\+: {\ttfamily phpunit} (relative to your local copy of PHPUnit)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxyref{Test}{p.}{class_test} Runner\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [x] Default configuration file\+: {\ttfamily phpunit.\+xml} (relative to your local copy of PHPUnit)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note\+: These configuration steps are current as of Php\+Storm 2019.\+2. In later versions, some settings might have been renamed or been moved around.

Now you can execute all tests or only some tests as needed. Please note that there are some subfolders within the {\ttfamily tests/} folder that must not be included in the test scope. This breaks running tests by folders for the end-\/to-\/end tests and the complete test suite.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To run all tests, please select \char`\"{}\+Defined in the configuration file\char`\"{} as test scope.
\item To run the unit tests, please select the {\ttfamily tests/unit/} folder as test scope.
\item You can also select individual files or folders from the unit or end-\/to-\/end tests as test scope.
\end{DoxyItemize}\doxysection{Structure of the self-\/test collection}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpunit_phpunit_tests__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md306}
Note\+: this section will change often while {\ttfamily tests/} is being refactored.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily configuration.\+xml}\+: the global configuration file which defines the internal {\ttfamily unit} and {\ttfamily end-\/to-\/end} tests suites
\item {\ttfamily tests/}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+files}\+: specialized helper files; input/output samples
\item {\ttfamily basic/}\+: fast tests covering all basics
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily configuration.\+basic.\+xml}\+: configuration file tailored for the {\ttfamily basic} suite
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily end-\/to-\/end/}\+: run PHPUnit as a separate process and observe its behaviour via console messages and the filesystem
\item {\ttfamily unit/}\+: unit tests for individual smallest components and integration tests of common use cases 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
