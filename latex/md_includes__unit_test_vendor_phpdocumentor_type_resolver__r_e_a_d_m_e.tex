The specification on types in Doc\+Blocks (PSR-\/5) describes various keywords and special constructs but also how to statically resolve the partial name of a Class into a Fully Qualified Class Name (FQCN).

PSR-\/5 also introduces an additional way to describe deeper elements than Classes, Interfaces and Traits called the Fully Qualified Structural Element Name (FQSEN). Using this it is possible to refer to methods, properties and class constants but also functions and global constants.

This package provides two Resolvers that are capable of


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Returning a series of Value Object for given expression while resolving any partial class names, and
\item Returning an FQSEN object after resolving any partial Structural Element Names into Fully Qualified Structural Element names.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\doxysubsection{Installing}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpdocumentor_type_resolver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md53}
The easiest way to install this library is with {\texttt{ Composer}} using the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ composer require phpdocumentor/type-resolver
\end{DoxyVerb}

This component can be used in one of two ways


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item To resolve a Type or
\item To resolve a Fully Qualified Structural Element Name
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The big difference between these two is in the number of things it can resolve.

The Type\+Resolver can resolve\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a php primitive or pseudo-\/primitive such as a string or void ({\ttfamily @var string} or {\ttfamily @return void}).
\item a composite such as an array of string ({\ttfamily @var string[]}).
\item a compound such as a string or integer ({\ttfamily @var string$\vert$integer}).
\item an array expression ({\ttfamily @var (string$\vert$\+Type\+Resolver)[]})
\item an object or interface such as the Type\+Resolver class ({\ttfamily @var Type\+Resolver} or {\ttfamily @var \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Type\+Resolver})
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
please note that if you want to pass partial class names that additional steps are necessary, see the chapter {\ttfamily Resolving partial classes and FQSENs} for more information. \end{quote}
Where the Fqsen\+Resolver can resolve\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Constant expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}MY\+\_\+\+CONSTANT})
\item Function expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}my\+Function()})
\item Class expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}My\+Class})
\item Interface expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}My\+Interface})
\item Trait expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}My\+Trait})
\item Class constant expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}My\+Class\+::\+MY\+\_\+\+CONSTANT})
\item Property expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}My\+Class\+::\$my\+Property})
\item Method expressions (i.\+e. {\ttfamily @see \textbackslash{}My\+Namespace\textbackslash{}My\+Class\+::my\+Method()})
\end{DoxyItemize}\doxysubsection{Resolving a type}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpdocumentor_type_resolver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md56}
In order to resolve a type you will have to instantiate the class {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Type\+Resolver} and call its {\ttfamily resolve} method like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$typeResolver = new \(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)TypeResolver();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$type = \$typeResolver-\/>resolve(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'string|integer'});}

\end{DoxyCode}


In this example you will receive a Value Object of class {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Compound} that has two elements, one of type {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}String\+\_\+} and one of type {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Integer}.

The real power of this resolver is in its capability to expand partial class names into fully qualified class names; but in order to do that we need an additional {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Context} class that will inform the resolver in which namespace the given expression occurs and which namespace aliases (or imports) apply.\doxysubsubsection{Resolving nullable types}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpdocumentor_type_resolver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md57}
Php 7.\+1 introduced nullable types e.\+g. {\ttfamily ?string}. Type resolver will resolve the original type without the nullable notation {\ttfamily ?} just like it would do without the {\ttfamily ?}. After that the type is wrapped in a {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Nullable} object. The {\ttfamily Nullable} type has a method to fetch the actual type.\doxysubsection{Resolving an FQSEN}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpdocumentor_type_resolver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md58}
A Fully Qualified Structural Element Name is a reference to another element in your code bases and can be resolved using the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Fqsen\+Resolver} class\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily resolve} method, like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$fqsenResolver = new \(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)FqsenResolver();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$fqsen = \$fqsenResolver-\/>resolve(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'\(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)FqsenResolver::resolve()'});}

\end{DoxyCode}


In this example we resolve a Fully Qualified Structural Element Name (meaning that it includes the full namespace, class name and element name) and receive a Value Object of type {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Fqsen}.

The real power of this resolver is in its capability to expand partial element names into Fully Qualified Structural Element Names; but in order to do that we need an additional {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Context} class that will inform the resolver in which namespace the given expression occurs and which namespace aliases (or imports) apply.\doxysubsection{Resolving partial Classes and Structural Element Names}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpdocumentor_type_resolver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md59}
Perhaps the best feature of this library is that it knows how to resolve partial class names into fully qualified class names.

For example, you have this file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{namespace }My\(\backslash\)Example;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{use phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)Types;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class }Classy}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{function} \_\_construct(\$context) \{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{function} otherFunction()\{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Suppose that you would want to resolve (and expand) the type in the {\ttfamily @var} tag and the element name in the {\ttfamily @see} tag.

For the resolvers to know how to expand partial names you have to provide a bit of {\itshape Context} for them by instantiating a new class named {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Context} with the name of the namespace and the aliases that are in play.\doxysubsubsection{Creating a Context}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpdocumentor_type_resolver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md60}
You can do this by manually creating a Context like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$context = new \(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)Types\(\backslash\)Context(}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{stringliteral}{'\(\backslash\)My\(\backslash\)Example'}, }
\DoxyCodeLine{    [ \textcolor{stringliteral}{'Types'} => \textcolor{stringliteral}{'\(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)Types'}]}
\DoxyCodeLine{);}

\end{DoxyCode}


Or by using the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Context\+Factory} to instantiate a new context based on a Reflector object or by providing the namespace that you\textquotesingle{}d like to extract and the source code of the file in which the given type expression occurs.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$contextFactory = new \(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)Types\(\backslash\)ContextFactory();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$context = \$contextFactory-\/>createFromReflector(\textcolor{keyword}{new} ReflectionMethod(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'\(\backslash\)My\(\backslash\)Example\(\backslash\)Classy'}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{'\_\_construct'}));}

\end{DoxyCode}


or


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$contextFactory = new \(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)Types\(\backslash\)ContextFactory();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$context = \$contextFactory-\/>createForNamespace(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'\(\backslash\)My\(\backslash\)Example'}, file\_get\_contents(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'My/Example/Classy.php'}));}

\end{DoxyCode}
\doxysubsubsection{Using the Context}\label{md_includes__unit_test_vendor_phpdocumentor_type_resolver__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md61}
After you have obtained a Context it is just a matter of passing it along with the {\ttfamily resolve} method of either Resolver class as second argument and the Resolvers will take this into account when resolving partial names.

To obtain the resolved class name for the {\ttfamily @var} tag in the example above you can do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$typeResolver = new \(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)TypeResolver();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$type = \$typeResolver-\/>resolve(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'Types\(\backslash\)Context'}, \$context);}

\end{DoxyCode}


When you do this you will receive an object of class {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Object\+\_\+} for which you can call the {\ttfamily get\+Fqsen} method to receive a Value Object that represents the complete FQSEN. So that would be {\ttfamily php\+Documentor\textbackslash{}Reflection\textbackslash{}Types\textbackslash{}Context}.

\begin{quote}
Why is the FQSEN wrapped in another object {\ttfamily Object\+\_\+}?

The resolve method of the Type\+Resolver only returns object with the interface {\ttfamily Type} and the FQSEN is a common type that does not represent a Type. Also\+: in some cases a type can represent an \char`\"{}\+Untyped Object\char`\"{}, meaning that it is an object (signified by the {\ttfamily object} keyword) but does not refer to a specific element using an FQSEN. \end{quote}
Another example is on how to resolve the FQSEN of a method as can be seen with the {\ttfamily @see} tag in the example above. To resolve that you can do the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$fqsenResolver = new \(\backslash\)phpDocumentor\(\backslash\)Reflection\(\backslash\)FqsenResolver();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$type = \$fqsenResolver-\/>resolve(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'Classy::otherFunction()'}, \$context);}

\end{DoxyCode}


Because Classy is a Class in the current namespace its FQSEN will have the {\ttfamily My\textbackslash{}Example} namespace and by calling the {\ttfamily resolve} method of the FQSEN Resolver you will receive an {\ttfamily Fqsen} object that refers to {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}My\textbackslash{}Example\textbackslash{}Classy\+::other\+Function()}.
